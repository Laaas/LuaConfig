# Warning
This mod is extremely WIP.

# About
JSON? Yuck. No comments, overly verbose, hard to read **and** modify,
what's there to like about it?
It's an abomination created from another abomination JS. What's it for?
Is it designed to be human-readable? Machine-readable? Unreadable?

What's even more amazing, though, is that someone though that JSON
was a good fit for configuration files in NS2.
But no longer will we suffer! No longer will we write poorly formatted
and inflexible configuration files!; We have Lua.

# Lua
Lua, which is used in NS2 for everything other than the engine itself, actually
[originated as a configuration tool](https://www.lua.org/history.html).

So I thought »Why doesn't NS2 just use Lua for configuration«, and so I made this mod.

# Limitations
## Client-side
Client-side configuration files will **not** be able to use Lua, since LuaJIT is
inherently unsafe, unless sandboxed properly. I will add in the ability to use it
client-side too some time in the future, but it will be very limited.

## Writing to the configuration files from NS2
Whenever a configuration file is written to, the original Lua configuration file
will **not** be updated. This is simply not possible without extreme levels of complexity
(and even then it would probably still not be good enough).

You must manually update the Lua configuration file, but I would personally recommend you
to not use Lua configuration for anything that has to be written to by NS2 itself.

# How to use
It's quite simple, really. You, as a server operator, install the mod onto your server. Then
you find the configuration file you want to convert, make a file with the same file stem
(i.e. the full file name without the dot and the extension), but suffix it with .lua.
Then you fill it with functionally equivalent Lua code and voilà! When NS2 attempts
to load the configuration file the next time, it will instead load the code inside
the Lua file.

# But I don't know Lua
[Here you go](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html)
Some things from [here](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html) also work!

# NB (Doesn't apply to shine plugins)
Instead of overwriting incorrect configuration files, a new rectified configuration file is created,
which has the suffix "-corrected.json". Please apply the changes from this to your own configuration file.
